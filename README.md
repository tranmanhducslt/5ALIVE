# 5ALIVE
adaptation of the 2021 Hasbro card game 5 Alive

## how to play
- be the last person to survive when all others run out of lives
- play cards to the discard pile and prevent its total from exceeding 21
- failing to do so loses a life, losing all five lives means elimination
- special Wild cards help reduce the risk OR force other players to lose
